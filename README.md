# Data structures, algorithms and complexity exercises

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms exercises from my university course. Each exercise is neatly organized within its dedicated folder, encompassing both the source code and pertinent documentation.

The exercises are provided in chronological order based on the laboratory sessions, providing a structured approach for study and review sessions. These exercises cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Sorting algorithms
- Search algorithms
- Data structures
- Graph algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Greedy algorithms
- Complexity analysis and Big-O notation

This compilation serves as a valuable resource for students aiming to strengthen their understanding of data structures and algorithms concepts and prepare for examinations effectively.

## How to compile and run

### Java
Navigate to the exercise directory and use `javac` to compile the Java file:
```sh
cd src/exercises/<eXX>/java/
javac *.java
java <MainClass> [arguments]
```

### C
Navigate to the exercise directory and use `make` to compile the C file:
```sh
cd src/exercises/<eXX>/c/
make
./<executable> [arguments]
```

Alternatively, compile manually with `gcc`:
```sh
gcc -g -o <executable> <source_files>
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Some exercises may require specific input files or command-line arguments. Check the individual exercise `pdf` for detailed instructions.
